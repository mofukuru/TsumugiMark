# TsumugiMark

TsumugiMark is a vertical writing plugin for Obsidian. It allows you to switch the standard Markdown editor to a vertical display, suitable for writing novels, screenplays, and other Japanese texts.

## Key Features (Note: This is a beta version, and features may not be stable)

- **Vertical Writing View**: Opens the active Markdown file in a separate pane with a vertical layout.
- **Live Preview**: Changes in the standard editor are reflected in the vertical view in real-time.
- **Edit in Vertical View**: You can directly edit text in the vertical view and save changes to the file.
- **Ruby Character Support**: Supports ruby characters (furigana) using the `|Kanji《kanji》` format.
- **Character Count**: Displays the total character count of the document in the status bar. When you select text, it also shows the character count of the selection.
- **Customization**: You can freely adjust the font family, font size, line spacing, and character counting method from the settings screen.

**Please be sure to test before use. Editing existing files may disrupt the layout of the Markdown editor.**
